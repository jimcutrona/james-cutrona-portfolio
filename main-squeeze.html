            <h2>Main Squeeze Magazine</h2>
            <p>While at Southern Oregon University, I designed and helped edit the 2018 issue of Main Squeeze, the
                school's
                student literary magazine. I also promoted the call for submissions and print issue's release on social
                media before helping distribute it to readers and contributors. We had three solicited
                contributors—poets Rodrigo Toscano and Anne Boyer and fiction writer Robert Arellano—and a selection of
                student writers and visual artists. I contributed one short story which was selected by the editorial
                team.
                <br><br>
                I used InDesign to design the layout and Photoshop to process the selected artwork for print. I created
                the lime liner art in InDesign using stock images of limes and the name of the magazine repeated over
                the limes and layered using blending modes found in Adobe products. I used the same layering principle
                to create the layered text on the front cover. The subsequent layout maintained simplicity to keep the
                reader's attention on the content of the contributor's writing. I chose Garamond, a favorite typeface of
                mine, for the body text because its both readable and visually pleasing. I chose Futura for titles
                because it is a subtle sans-serif with the personality of an artist statement (and it pairs nicely with
                Garamond). I used generous line-height and margins because I believe the white space adds an appropriate
                weight to literary writing and art.
                <br><br>
                Throughout the process, I maintained an organized library of content and documented my workflow for the
                next team to take advantage of; this included style-guides based on the InDesign paragraph styles I used
                to maintain visual consistency and physical efficiency.Throughout the process, I maintained an organized

                efficiency.

                We teamed with Your Town Press Inc., an excellent press located in Salem, Oregon, to get the issue
                printed. I put together a custom set of print and export settings to ensure the heavily collaborative
                project came off the press as intended and agreed upon on-screen. These print and export settings were
                also something I passed down to the next team in the documentation.

        <p class="section-description"> While designing the 2018 issue, I created social content for Main Squeeze that
            riffed on an unspoken citrus theme. Below are some examples, all consisting of photographed citrus fruit
            designed in a digital, colorful, loud style attempting to fit the student lit mag aesthetic of the magazine.
            <br><br>
            If I had the chance to take on this role with what I know now about social strategy, I would have set up a
            content management system like Hootsuite to make it easy for the team to schedule the content and keep our
            presence consistent with more initial reach and eventual readers when it came time to distribute. </p>

        <p class="section-description">I used InDesign for almost all the design work (besides image processing in
            Photoshop). For marketing and content management, I set up social business accounts on Instagram and
            Facebook and built a WordPress site. I wrote updates on submission deadlines and the release date on social
            and, in the blog section of the WordPress site, I wrote posts to discuss how things were going on the
            editorial side and some thoughts on the magazine's collective vision.
            <br><br>
            In addition to editorial design, I provided copy editing for grammatical and style errors found in selected
            contributors' final drafts.</p>
