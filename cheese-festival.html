            <h2>Oregon Cheese Festival Video</h2>
            <p>I was contracted by the Oregon Cheese Guild and Rogue Creamery to produce a short promotional video of
                the 2019 Oregon Cheese Festival. It was a joy to shoot the event â€” I got to refine my palate for fine
                local cheeses while becoming a more experienced videographer. The finished video featured a balanced
                selection of shots showcasing a jolly crowd and a smorgasbord of cheese, wine, beer, and specialty
                vendors. We partnered up with local songwriters The Brothers Reed to garnish the video with a tune aptly
                titled "Southern Oregonia."
                <br><br>
                <strong> Objectives/Deliverables:</strong>
                The main deliverable was to visually showcase the variety of vendors (particularly sponsors) and
                enjoyment of the crowd. I achieved this by getting shots of booths in all areas of the festival and
                catching genuine interactions between vendors and attendees (and between attendees and cheese). I also
                recorded ambiance to include the energy of the crowd below the solicited Brothers Reed song.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Tools and Software:</strong>
                I shot the video on a  <u>Nikon D7000</u> with a Nikon 18-300mm lens and an older Nikon NIKKOR 50mm f/1.4 Lens
                with a manual focus. I choose the 18-300mm when focusing on interactions because I wanted to have the
                option of catching moments from afar; I chose the 50mm for closeups and more depth of field control.
                Other equipment included a Coman monopod and a Tascam DR-40 hand recorder (to capture crowd ambiance). I
                put together the video in <u>Adobe Premiere</u>.
